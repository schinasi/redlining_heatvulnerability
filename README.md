We then subset the data to include residential properties only. We then overlaid the lat/long points with historical redlining data, accessed from the University of Richmond's Mapping Inequality project (https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data) and randomly selected 100 properties that fell within each of the HOLC grade categories (A, B, C, D). 

We then used google street view to inventory the properties. THe results from the inventory are presented in the datafile called p_holc_v_census1940new3.csv
